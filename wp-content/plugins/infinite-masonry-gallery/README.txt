Infinite Masonry Gallery is a plugin that displays your images in a beautiful masonry style, responsively across all browsers and devices. For efficiency, images are loaded on demand, guaranteeing super fast site loading speeds.
And even with the fast loading speeds, the impressive blur effect will bridge the time until the full-res image is loaded. Infinite Masonry Gallery comes with a sleek and efficient fullscreen slider that also loads images only on demand.

Main Features:

*   Infinite Scroll Gallery
*   Create galleries and include them with shortcodes
*   On-demand image loading
*   Masonry layout (dynamic heights, pinterest-like)
*   Optional fullscreen slider (on-demand image loading)

Just install it, and create a new gallery. After you have saved it, a shortcode will be visible. Just copy-paste it anywhere in a page editor.
